# Loan-Management-System-Experiment
 
In this Repo, i experiment with python and c++ features to create a Loan Management System. This repo basically works as a proof of concept, especially with python features that I am not fully skilled in. The whole idea is to actually see how things work, take a look at trade offs in readability maintainability, and scalability. This allows me to gain experience in the python language, while also having first hand experience on the structure of the loan management system.
Currently, I intend to use the loan management cpp library as is. 

# Current Features
  1.) Generate data <br>
  2.) Server functionality <br>
  3.) Storing data in sqlite3 database <br>
  4.) Recieving user data from web app <br>
  5.) Recieving user data from command line interface <br>
  5.) Displaying user data once received from database both in cli and web app <br>
  6.) Using csv file for analysis of data in excel, possibly data analysis in python <br>

 # Known Future Changes
  1.) A revision of the risk assessment methods to utilise statistics, this will be added once i have finished a basic statistics library in c++ <br>
