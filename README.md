# Loan-Management-System-Experiment
 
In this Repo, i experiment with python and c++ features to create a Loan Management System. This repo basically works as a proof of concept, especially with python features that I am not fully skilled in. The whole idea is to actually see how things work, take a look at trade offs in readability maintainability, and scalability. This allows me to gain experience in the python language, while also having first hand experience on the structure of the loan management system.
Currently, I intend to use the loan management cpp library as is. 

# Current Features

 Server functionality
 Storing data in sqlite3 database
