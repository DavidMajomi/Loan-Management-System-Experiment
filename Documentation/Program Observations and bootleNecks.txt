        Some Possible Program bottle necks, or issues in performance
1.) Duplicate vectors for storing user data in database, due to function calls
        Fix: Pass the vectors by reference.

2.) Loan Class stores details for a personal loan, but doesnt leave room for any other loan types like business loans. 
        Fix: Make loan a personal loan class inheriting from the loan class.
3.) Poor organization of executable code
        Fix: 



A.) Loan Management System Sever.h
        1.) storeDataInDb function
                I.) Lack of thread safety in the database.
                II.) Increased time complexity due to nested for loop for string processing while preparing sqlite3 statement.
                III.) Incresaed memory usage for storing string values of user data when they can be converted directly while added to the valsToInsert Vector.
                IV.) The valsToInsert Vector isnt necessary because there are better ways of string processing such as direct string concatenation.
                V.)
