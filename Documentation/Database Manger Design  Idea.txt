Main idea:
    A simple Database Manager that works as simple function calls to obfuscate the sqlite statements.

Idea:
1.) Data retreival for table data requires
    A.) The select statement as a const char *
    B.) Database path const char *
    C.) Could return vector of tuples or 2 dimensional vector, why not both.
    D.) Built - in exception handling.
    E.) Database mutexes and others must be handled by calling function.
2.) Data insertion requires:
    A.) const char * of all data to insert. Could have a string alternative using polymorphism
    B.) bool insert with transaction or not.
    C.) const char * database isnert format (the header)
    D.) Database path const char *
